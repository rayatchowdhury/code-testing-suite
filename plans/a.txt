- create a extreme well designed beautiful elegant material design pyside6 app

main window will have two widgets
1. sidebar
2. Display Area

the sidebar will have 4 buttons
1. Code Editor
2. Stress tester
3. Tle tester 
4. Help Center

also each respective files has details of what each button will do.

clicking each button will change the main window. aka if I click on the "Code Editor" button the sidebar will have a new button open file, save file, run, etc and the display area will have a code editor.
other than the main window, each window will havee a go back button on bottom of sidebar clicking on which will go back to the previous window

just create the basic structure of the app with beautifull design and the rest of the work will be done by me.
each button should have a perfect size and should be properly aligned.
sidebar should be collapsible.
sidebar area and display area should have a perfect color combination.
