# Console Logging Improvements

## Issue 1: Duplicate Language Switch Messages

Console logging showed inconsistent and duplicate messages when switching languages:

**Before:**
```
Switching Correct Code from cpp to py
Switching to file: C:\Users\Rayat\.code_testing_suite\workspace\correct.py
Comparator: Switched to PY in Correct Code
Language change completed for Correct Code
```

### Root Cause
Two separate logging mechanisms:
1. **TestTabWidget** (generic): Logged at widget level
2. **Tool-specific views** (Comparator/Benchmarker/Validator): Logged at view level

This caused redundant and inconsistent output.

### Solution - Language Switch Logging

#### 1. Removed Generic Logs from TestTabWidget
**File:** `src/app/presentation/widgets/display_area_widgets/test_tab_widget.py`

**Removed:**
- ❌ `print(f"Switching {tab_name} from {old_language} to {new_language}")`
- ❌ `print(f"Language change completed for {tab_name}")`
- ❌ `print(f"Switching to file: {file_path}")`

**Kept (improved):**
- ✅ `print(f"  → Created new {new_language.UPPER()} file: {os.path.basename(file_path)}")`
  - Only shown when creating new files
  - Uses clean indented format with arrow prefix
  - Shows just the filename, not full path

#### 2. Standardized Tool-Specific Logs
**Files:** 
- `src/app/presentation/views/comparator/comparator_display_area.py`
- `src/app/presentation/views/benchmarker/benchmarker_display_area.py`
- `src/app/presentation/views/validator/validator_display_area.py`

**Updated format:**
```python
# Before: print(f"Comparator: Switched to {language.upper()} in {tab_name}")
# After:  print(f"Comparator: Switched {tab_name} to {language.upper()}")
```

**Benefits:**
- More natural language flow: "Switched Correct Code to PY" vs "Switched to PY in Correct Code"
- Consistent across all three tools
- Tool name prefix makes it clear which window triggered the change

### Result - Language Switch

**Before (messy, 4 messages):**
```
Switching Correct Code from cpp to py
Switching to file: C:\Users\Rayat\.code_testing_suite\workspace\correct.py
Comparator: Switched to PY in Correct Code
Language change completed for Correct Code
```

**After (clean, 1 message):**
```
Comparator: Switched Correct Code to PY
  → Created new PY file: correct.py  (only if creating new file)
```

## Issue 2: Incorrect Compilation Status Messages

Compilation status messages showed wrong file extensions after language switching:

**Before:**
```
✅ generator.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ correct.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ Successfully compiled TestCode.java
```

**Problem:** Even when Correct Code is Python, it showed "correct.exe is up-to-date" instead of recognizing it's a Python file.

### Root Cause
The BaseCompiler's `_parallel_compile_all()` method hardcoded ".exe" extension in the skip message:
```python
self.compilationOutput.emit(
    f"✅ {file_key}.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation\n", 'success'
)
```

This ignored the actual language and file type.

### Solution - Language-Aware Compilation Messages

**File:** `src/app/core/tools/base/base_compiler.py`

**Changed from:**
```python
for file_key in files_to_compile:
    if self._needs_recompilation(file_key):
        files_needing_compilation.append(file_key)
    else:
        self.compilationOutput.emit(
            f"✅ {file_key}.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation\n", 'success'
        )
```

**Changed to:**
```python
for file_key in files_to_compile:
    if self._needs_recompilation(file_key):
        files_needing_compilation.append(file_key)
    else:
        # Get language-specific status message
        language = self.file_languages.get(file_key, Language.UNKNOWN)
        if language == Language.PYTHON:
            source_file = self.files[file_key]
            self.compilationOutput.emit(
                f"✅ {os.path.basename(source_file)} has no syntax errors\n", 'success'
            )
        elif language == Language.JAVA:
            source_file = self.files[file_key]
            class_file = os.path.basename(source_file).replace('.java', '.class')
            self.compilationOutput.emit(
                f"✅ {class_file} is up-to-date, skipping compilation\n", 'success'
            )
        else:  # C++ and others
            executable_file = self.executables[file_key]
            self.compilationOutput.emit(
                f"✅ {os.path.basename(executable_file)} is up-to-date, skipping compilation\n", 'success'
            )
```

### Result - Compilation Status

**Before (wrong extensions):**
```
✅ generator.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ correct.exe is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ Successfully compiled test.cpp
```

**After (language-aware):**
```
✅ generator.py has no syntax errors
✅ correct.py has no syntax errors
✅ Successfully compiled test.cpp
```

Or with Java:
```
✅ Generator.class is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ Correct.class is up-to-date, skipping compilation
✅ Successfully compiled Test.java
```

### Benefits
✅ **Accurate messages**: Shows actual file extensions based on current language  
✅ **Language-appropriate wording**: "has no syntax errors" for Python vs "up-to-date" for compiled languages  
✅ **Consistent with actual files**: Messages match what's actually being checked (source vs executable vs class)  
✅ **Better user feedback**: Users understand what validation/compilation happened

## Overall Improvements

### All Changes Summary
1. ✅ **Clean output**: Only one log message per language switch (not 3-4)  
2. ✅ **Consistent format**: All tools use same "ToolName: Switched TabName to LANG" pattern  
3. ✅ **Informative**: Tool prefix shows which window is active  
4. ✅ **Minimal**: File creation only logged when actually creating new files  
5. ✅ **Better UX**: Indented sub-messages with arrows for visual hierarchy  
6. ✅ **Language-aware compilation messages**: Accurate file types and appropriate wording
7. ✅ **No misleading information**: Messages reflect actual language and file state

## Testing
- Manually tested switching languages in Comparator, Benchmarker, and Validator
- Verified file creation logs appear only when needed
- Confirmed no duplicate messages
- Tested compilation messages with C++, Python, and Java files
- Verified correct extensions shown for each language
- All 135 automated tests still passing
