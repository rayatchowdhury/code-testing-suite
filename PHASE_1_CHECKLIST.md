## Key Metrics Established
- **Complex Files Identified**: 40+ files requiring attention
- **Refactoring Targets**: 23 methods >50 lines, 8 methods >100 lines
- **Current Architecture**: Flat structure with 180+ Python files
- **Target Architecture**: 4-layer src/ structure with clear separation

## Risk Assessment
- **Migration Risk**: Medium (mitigated by comprehensive backup strategy)
- **Design Preservation Risk**: Low (detailed audit and validation procedures)
- **Performance Risk**: Low (baseline established, monitoring in place)
- **Rollback Risk**: Very Low (multiple recovery options documented)
