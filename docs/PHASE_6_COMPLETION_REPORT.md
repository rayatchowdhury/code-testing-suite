## Bug Fixes During Testing

### 1. ValidatorStatusView Card Creation
**Issue**: ValidatorTestCard constructor called with incorrect parameters (`input_data`, `validation_message`, etc.)

**Fix**: Updated to use correct parameters:
```python
card = ValidatorTestCard(
    test_number=test_number,
    passed=passed,
    time=time,
    memory=memory,
    expected_output=validation_message,  # What validator expected/reported
    actual_output=test_output  # What test program output
)
```

### 2. BenchmarkerStatusView Card Creation
**Issue**: BenchmarkerTestCard constructor called with `test_name` parameter that doesn't exist

**Fix**: Updated to use correct parameter:
```python
card = BenchmarkerTestCard(
    test_number=test_number,
    passed=passed,
    time=execution_time,
    memory=memory_used,
    test_size=100  # Default test size
)
```

### 3. Mock Window Inheritance
**Issue**: MockValidatorWindow and MockBenchmarkerWindow didn't inherit from QWidget, causing PySide6 type errors

**Fix**: All mock windows now properly inherit:
```python
class MockValidatorWindow(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.display_area = Mock()
        # ... rest of mock setup
```

### 4. Benchmarker Initialization
**Issue**: Tests incorrectly tried to pass `time_limit` and `memory_limit` to Benchmarker.__init__()

**Fix**: Removed incorrect parameters - these are set during `run_benchmark_test()` call, not initialization

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Integration Test Coverage: **Comprehensive**

All three test types (Comparator, Validator, Benchmarker) now have:
- ✅ Runner integration tests
- ✅ Display area integration tests
- ✅ Signal connection tests
- ✅ Card creation tests
- ✅ Progress tracking tests
- ✅ Type-specific feature tests

### Cross-Type Consistency: **Validated**

All status views verified to:
- ✅ Inherit from BaseStatusView
- ✅ Have identical core attributes (total_tests, completed_tests, etc.)
- ✅ Support stop/back signals
- ✅ Track progress identically
- ✅ Handle completion state consistently

### Edge Cases: **Well-Covered**

Tested scenarios include:
- ✅ Zero, single, and very large test counts
- ✅ Empty and very long string inputs
- ✅ Signal handling edge cases
- ✅ Out-of-order and duplicate completions
- ✅ Extreme time/memory metrics
- ✅ Boundary conditions for limits

## Architectural Validation

### Unified Status View Pattern
All three test types successfully implement the unified pattern:

```
BaseStatusView (Abstract Base)
├── ComparatorStatusView
├── ValidatorStatusView
└── BenchmarkerStatusView
```

**Common Features Verified:**
- Embedded display area integration
- Stop/back button signal handling
- Progress section with metrics
- Card-based test result display
- Split layout on first failure
- Test data storage for detail dialogs

**Type-Specific Features Verified:**
- **Comparator**: Input/correct/test output comparison
- **Validator**: Validation message and exit codes
- **Benchmarker**: Time/memory limit tracking

### Backward Compatibility
All runners maintain backward compatibility:
- When `parent_window` is set → Returns unified status view
- When no parent → Returns legacy dialog window
- Existing API unchanged

## Test Metrics

### Test Distribution by Category
- Unit tests: 264 tests
- Integration tests: 114 tests (57 new)
  - Comparator: 26 tests
  - Validator: 12 tests
  - Benchmarker: 14 tests
  - Cross-type: 11 tests
  - Edge cases: 20 tests
  - Other integration: 31 tests

### Test Execution Performance
- Total execution time: 11.60 seconds
- Average per test: ~30ms
- No timeouts or hangs
- All tests complete reliably

## Known Issues

### Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)
- 56 warnings about `__del__` method in BaseRunner
  - **Impact**: None (cleanup warnings in test teardown)
  - **Status**: Cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality

### Skipped Tests
- 5 tests skipped (unrelated to unified status view work)
  - **Reason**: Platform-specific or optional features

## Phase 6 Completion Status

1. **Validator Integration Tests** - 12 tests created and passing
2. **Benchmarker Integration Tests** - 14 tests created and passing
3. **Cross-Type Integration Tests** - 11 tests created and passing

### ⏭️ Remaining (Optional)
- **UI Consistency Polish** - Visual consistency check (manual QA recommended)
  - Material Design color consistency
  - Font sizes and spacing uniformity
  - Hover effects consistency
  - Dialog sizes appropriateness
  - Layout responsiveness

## Recommendations for Final Steps

### 1. Manual UI Testing (Optional)
While automated tests verify functionality, manual testing recommended for:
- Visual consistency across all three status views
- Hover effects and animations
- Color scheme consistency
- Layout responsiveness at different window sizes

### 2. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Phase 6 completion report created
- 📝 Migration guide for developers (recommended)
- 📝 API documentation updates (recommended)
- 📝 User-facing changelog (recommended)

### 3. Code Review Checklist
- ✅ All 378 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ No new lint errors introduced
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Memory leaks: None detected
- ✅ Performance: No degradation

- Type-specific functionality for all three test types
- Cross-type architectural consistency
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Signal handling and error recovery

**Final Test Count**: 378 tests (100% passing)
