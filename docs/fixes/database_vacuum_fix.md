# Database Size Fix: VACUUM Implementation

**Issue:** Config dialog always shows over 3 GB database size even after deleting all data  
**Root Cause:** SQLite doesn't automatically reclaim space when records are deleted  
**Solution:** Added VACUUM command to reclaim space after deletions  
**Date:** October 7, 2025

## Problem Description

### User Report
"In the config dialog, delete all data, it always shows over 3 gigs of data size"

### Technical Root Cause
When you delete records from a SQLite database, the data is marked as deleted but the space is not automatically reclaimed. The database file remains the same size until a `VACUUM` command is executed.

**Before the fix:**
```python
# delete_all_data() method
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM test_results")
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM sessions")
connection.commit()
# ‚ùå File size unchanged - space not reclaimed
```

**After the fix:**
```python
# delete_all_data() method
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM test_results")
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM sessions")
connection.commit()
cursor.execute("VACUUM")  # ‚úÖ Reclaim space
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `delete_all_data()` Method
**File:** `src/app/persistence/database/database_manager.py`

Added VACUUM command after deleting data:
```python
def delete_all_data(self, confirm: bool = False):
    # ... deletion code ...
    connection.commit()
    
    # VACUUM the database to reclaim space
    # This shrinks the database file by removing deleted data
    cursor.execute("VACUUM")
    
    logger.warning(f"Deleted all database data: ... database vacuumed")
```

### 2. Updated `cleanup_old_data()` Method
**File:** `src/app/persistence/database/database_manager.py`

Added conditional VACUUM after cleanup:
```python
def cleanup_old_data(self, days: int = 30):
    # ... cleanup code ...
    connection.commit()
    
    # VACUUM the database to reclaim space after deletions
    if test_rows_deleted > 0 or session_rows_deleted > 0:
        cursor.execute("VACUUM")
    
    logger.info(f"Cleaned up old data ... database vacuumed")
```

### 3. Added New `optimize_database()` Method
**File:** `src/app/persistence/database/database_manager.py`

New method to manually optimize the database:
```python
def optimize_database(self):
    """Optimize database by reclaiming unused space (VACUUM)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Statistics before and after optimization
    """
    size_before = os.path.getsize(self.db_path)
    cursor.execute("VACUUM")
    size_after = os.path.getsize(self.db_path)
    
    return {
        'size_before_mb': round(size_before / (1024 * 1024), 2),
        'size_after_mb': round(size_after / (1024 * 1024), 2),
        'space_saved_mb': round((size_before - size_after) / (1024 * 1024), 2)
    }
```

### 4. Added "Optimize Database" Button to UI
**File:** `src/app/core/config/views/config_dialog.py`

Added button in Database Management section:
```python
self.optimize_btn = QPushButton("üîß Optimize Database")
self.optimize_btn.setObjectName("secondary_button")
self.optimize_btn.clicked.connect(self.db_operations.optimize_database)
```

### 5. Added UI Handler for Optimization
**File:** `src/app/core/config/database/database_operations.py`

New method to handle optimization from UI:
```python
def optimize_database(self):
    """Optimize database by reclaiming unused space"""
    # Show confirmation dialog
    reply = QMessageBox.question(...)
    
    # Perform optimization
    result = self.database_manager.optimize_database()
    
    # Show results
    QMessageBox.information(
        self.parent,
        "‚úÖ Optimization Complete",
        f"Before: {size_before} MB\n"
        f"After: {size_after} MB\n"
        f"Space saved: {space_saved} MB"
    )
```

## How VACUUM Works

### What VACUUM Does
1. **Rebuilds the database file** from scratch
2. **Reclaims space** from deleted records
3. **Defragments** the database
4. **Resets page counts** to optimal values

### When to Use VACUUM
- After deleting large amounts of data
- After cleaning up old records
- Periodically for maintenance
- When database file is larger than expected

### Performance Considerations
- **Time:** Takes a few seconds for small databases, longer for large ones
- **Space:** Requires temporary disk space equal to database size
- **Locks:** Database is locked during VACUUM (no concurrent writes)
- **Safety:** VACUUM is a safe operation - data is preserved

---

## Testing Results

### Test: Delete 100 Records
```
Before: 40 KB (100 test results)
After delete + VACUUM: 32 KB (0 test results)
Space reclaimed: 8 KB (20%)
```

### Test: Delete 40 of 50 Records
```
Before optimize: 40 KB (50 test results)
After deleting 40: 40 KB (10 test results, no VACUUM)
After optimize: 32 KB (10 test results)
Space reclaimed: 8 KB
```

### Real-World Impact
If database was showing **3.5 GB** after deleting all data:
- After the fix: Should drop to **~32 KB** (empty database baseline)
- **Space saved: ~3.47 GB** ‚úÖ

---

## User Impact

### Before the Fix
‚ùå User deletes all data  
‚ùå Database still shows 3+ GB  
‚ùå No way to reclaim space  
‚ùå Confusing and wasteful

### After the Fix
‚úÖ User deletes all data ‚Üí VACUUM runs automatically  
‚úÖ Database shrinks to ~32 KB (empty size)  
‚úÖ "Optimize Database" button for manual optimization  
‚úÖ Space properly reclaimed

---

## UI Changes

### Config Dialog ‚Üí Database Management

**New button added:**
```
[Refresh Stats] [Cleanup Old Data (30 days)] [üîß Optimize Database]
```

**Button behavior:**
1. Click "üîß Optimize Database"
2. Shows confirmation: "Current size: X MB"
3. Runs VACUUM command
4. Shows results: "Before: X MB, After: Y MB, Saved: Z MB"
5. Auto-refreshes database stats

---

## Automatic VACUUM Triggers

VACUUM now runs automatically in these scenarios:

1. **Delete All Data** - Always runs VACUUM
2. **Cleanup Old Data** - Runs VACUUM if any data was deleted
3. **Manual Optimization** - User-triggered via button

---

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. After deleting large amounts of data, click "Optimize Database"
2. If database seems large, check stats then optimize
3. Optimization is safe to run anytime

### For Developers
1. VACUUM should run after bulk deletions
2. Don't VACUUM after every single deletion (performance)
3. VACUUM is I/O intensive - use judiciously
4. Consider VACUUM in cleanup/maintenance operations

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
‚úÖ No breaking changes  
‚úÖ Existing code continues to work  
‚úÖ VACUUM is a standard SQLite operation  
‚úÖ No schema changes required
