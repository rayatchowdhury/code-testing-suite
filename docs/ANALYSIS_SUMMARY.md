## ‚úÖ Recently Completed Issues

### Issue #5: Global Variable Abuse in editor_widget.py - RESOLVED
**Completed:** Before October 22, 2025  
**Impact:** Eliminated 7 module-level globals for lazy loading  
**Solution Implemented:** ComponentLoader class pattern

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced 7 global variables (`_markdown`, `_pygments_*`, `_syntax_highlighters`, `_editor_ai`, `_ai_panel`)
- Replaced 6 `_import_*()` functions with property-based lazy loading
- Created `ComponentLoader` class with proper encapsulation
- Added `get_component_loader()` factory function for dependency injection
- Made all components testable, injectable, and resettable

**Benefits achieved:**
‚úÖ No more global state pollution  
‚úÖ Thread-safe per instance (no shared globals)  
‚úÖ Testable (can be mocked and reset)  
‚úÖ Injectable (can pass different instances)  
‚úÖ Proper encapsulation with Python properties  
‚úÖ Fallback handling for missing dependencies (e.g., markdown)

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/presentation/shared/components/editor/component_loader.py` (NEW)
- `src/app/presentation/shared/components/editor/editor_widget.py` (UPDATED)
