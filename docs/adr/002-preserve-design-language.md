# ADR-002: Preserve Exact Design Language During Migration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Current UI uses custom Material Design implementation with specific:
- Color schemes and gradients (dark theme with blue accents)
- Component behaviors and animations (sidebar transitions, hover effects)
- Layout patterns and spacing (280px sidebar, consistent 8px/16px grid)
- Typography and iconography (system fonts with monospace code)

Users are familiar with the current interface and any visual changes could disrupt workflow.

## Decision  
Maintain pixel-perfect UI/UX during migration:
- No visual changes whatsoever - preserve all colors, spacing, typography
- All interactions work identically - hover effects, transitions, animations
- Performance must not degrade - startup time, responsiveness maintained
- Styles preserved exactly - CSS rules, component behavior unchanged

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Users experience zero disruption during migration
- Maintains brand identity and user satisfaction
- Reduces risk of user complaints or adoption issues
- Preserves significant UI/UX development investment
- Allows focus on code quality without UI concerns

**Negative:**
- Constrains some refactoring options (cannot change component interfaces)
- Requires careful testing and validation at each step
- May limit some performance optimizations that would change behavior
- Increases migration complexity due to preservation requirements
