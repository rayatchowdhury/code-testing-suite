# FOUND THE ISSUE!

## The Problem

Your generator is being run with **`pypy3`** which is:
1. Probably not installed on your system
2. Or very slow to start (PyPy has long startup time)
3. Causing all tests to hang at the generator stage

## The Evidence

```
DEBUG: Generator command: ['pypy3', '-u', 'C:\\Users\\Rayat\\.code_testing_suite\\workspace\\validator\\generator.py']
```

Notice: **No tests complete** - they all stop after "Running generator"

## The Solution

You need to change the Python interpreter from `pypy3` to regular `python` or `py`.

### How to Fix:

1. **In the Validator window**, look for Python settings or interpreter settings
2. Change from `pypy3` to `python` or `py`
3. OR check your application settings for Python interpreter configuration

### Quick Test

Open a terminal and try:
```powershell
pypy3 --version
```

If you get an error like "pypy3 is not recognized", that confirms PyPy3 isn't installed.

Then try:
```powershell
python --version
```

Use whichever Python command works on your system.

## Why This Happened

The app is configured to use PyPy3 (a faster Python implementation) but:
- PyPy3 isn't installed on your system
- OR it's configured incorrectly
- The generator subprocess hangs waiting for PyPy3 to start

## What Should Happen

With correct Python:
```
DEBUG: Generator command: ['python', '-u', 'generator.py']
DEBUG: Generator finished
DEBUG: Generator stdout: '2\n'
DEBUG: Stage 2: Running test solution
...
```

**Can you check if there's a Python interpreter setting in the app and change it from pypy3 to python?**
