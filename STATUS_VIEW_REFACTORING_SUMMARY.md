## 📁 New Architecture

### Created Files (Phase 1)
```
src/app/presentation/widgets/status_view/
├── __init__.py                (37 lines)   - Module exports
├── models.py                  (174 lines)  - Data models (TestResult, TestExecutionState, TestStatistics)
├── presenter.py               (200 lines)  - Coordination logic (StatusViewPresenter)
├── widgets.py                 (667 lines)  - Pure UI components
└── cards.py                   (43 lines)   - Domain-specific card wrappers
```

### Refactored Files (Phase 2)
```
src/app/presentation/views/
├── comparator/comparator_status_view.py    - Uses presenter composition
├── validator/validator_status_view.py      - Uses presenter composition
└── benchmarker/benchmarker_status_view.py  - Uses presenter composition
```

### Deleted Files (Phase 5)
```
❌ src/app/presentation/widgets/unified_status_view.py       (280 lines) - God Object
❌ src/app/presentation/widgets/status_view_widgets.py       (667 lines) - Monolithic widgets
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### Worker Pipeline Segments
- **Consistent Color System**: Uses MATERIAL_COLORS from app design language
  - 🔵 Primary Blue (`#0096C7`) - Generation stages (all test types)
  - 💜 Purple (`#B565D8`) - Middle/execution stages
  - 💖 Accent Pink (`#F72585`) - Final evaluation stages

- **Professional Styling**:
  - Dark base with color accent in middle (inspired by sidebar/console titles)
  - Subtle 4-stop horizontal gradients
  - 1px borders with 60% opacity
  - Consistent inactive state (gray)
  - No font size changes (prevents layout shift)

- **Pipeline Labels**:
  - Comparator: "Generating Input" → "Expected Output" → "Evaluating Test"
  - Validator: "Generating Input" → "Running Test" → "Validating"
  - Benchmarker: "Generating Input" → "Benchmarking" (50-50 split)

## 🔧 Real Worker Tracking

### Core Implementation
Modified `base_test_worker.py` to emit real worker activity:
```python
workerBusy = Signal(int, int)   # worker_id, test_number
workerIdle = Signal(int)        # worker_id
```

### Thread ID Mapping
- Uses `threading.get_ident()` to detect worker threads
- Maintains stable worker_id mapping (1-8)
- Thread-safe with locking

### UI Integration
- Connected signals in `base_window.py`
- Added handlers in all three status views
- Presenter tracks real worker→test assignments
- Accurate debugging information for users

## 🏗️ Architecture Pattern

### Model-Presenter-View Separation

**Model (`models.py`)**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TestResult:
    test_number: int
    passed: bool
    time: float
    memory: float
    data: dict
```

**Presenter (`presenter.py`)**
```python
class StatusViewPresenter:
    def __init__(self, header, performance, progress_bar, cards_section, test_type):
        # Knows about widgets, not business logic
        
    def handle_worker_busy(self, worker_id, test_number):
        # Real worker tracking
        
    def handle_test_result(self, result: TestResult):
        # Coordinates widget updates
```

**View (Status Views)**
```python
class ComparatorStatusView(QWidget):
    def on_worker_busy(self, worker_id, test_number):
        self.presenter.handle_worker_busy(worker_id, test_number)
        
    def on_test_completed(self, ...):
        result = TestResult.from_comparator(...)
        self.presenter.handle_test_result(result)
```

## ✅ Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Maintainability**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Each file has one clear purpose
   - Easy to locate and modify code

### 2. **Testability**
   - Models are pure data (frozen dataclasses)
   - Presenter has no Qt dependencies
   - Easy to mock and test

### 3. **Reusability**
   - Models can be used outside UI
   - Presenter logic shared across test types
   - Widgets are generic components

### 4. **Extensibility**
   - Adding new test types: implement factory method
   - New UI features: add to widgets
   - New coordination logic: add to presenter

### 5. **Debugging**
   - Real worker tracking shows actual execution
   - Clear separation makes issues easy to isolate
   - Professional visualization aids understanding

- Deleted status_view_widgets.py
- Cleaned __pycache__ files
- Verified app functionality

## 📝 Key Technical Decisions

1. **Frozen Dataclasses**: Immutable data prevents accidental mutations
2. **Factory Methods**: `from_comparator()`, `from_validator()`, etc. for clean initialization
3. **Thread ID Mapping**: Stable worker IDs despite ThreadPoolExecutor limitations
4. **Composition over Inheritance**: Views use presenter instead of inheriting from base
5. **Signal-based Updates**: Real-time worker tracking via Qt signals
6. **Consistent Styling**: All segments match app design language

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **God Objects are Hard to Test**: Mixing concerns makes everything harder
2. **Presenter Pattern Works Well with Qt**: Separates coordination from rendering
3. **Real Tracking > Simulated**: Users wanted actual debugging information
4. **Consistency Matters**: Font size changes cause layout shifts (annoying!)
5. **Inspiration ≠ Copy**: Titlebar gradients needed scaling down for segments

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the user for:
- Demanding real tracking (not simulated)
- Catching the font scaling issue
- Insisting on appropriate styling (not blatant copying)
- Clear feedback on label text and sizing

The refactoring is stronger because of these insights!
