# 🔧 Results Window Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

The Results window was appearing empty because of a missing navigation handler in the main window.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The main window's `handle_button_click` method was not including 'Results' in the list of buttons it could handle. When users clicked the "Results" button, it wasn't being processed.

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

### Modified File: `views/main_window.py`

**Before:**
```python
elif button_text in ['Code Editor', 'Stress Tester', 'TLE Tester', 'Help Center']:
```

**After:**
```python
elif button_text in ['Code Editor', 'Stress Tester', 'TLE Tester', 'Results', 'Help Center']:
```

## ✅ Verification

1. **Database Connection**: ✓ Working correctly
2. **Data Loading**: ✓ 5 test results found in database
3. **Widget Creation**: ✓ TestResultsWidget loads data properly  
4. **Window Navigation**: ✓ Results button now works from main menu
5. **Results Display**: ✓ Table shows test results with proper formatting
